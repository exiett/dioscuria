            <p>Sharing knowledge and information is the true purpose of the internet. Big corporations have taken ownership of the space we crafted with our friends and turned it against us, making it a machine designed to drain our belongings - mental and physical - while turning us into products.</p>
            <p>Where did we go wrong?</p>
            <p>How did we let it come to this?</p>
            <p>The internet is finally boring and stupid, like they wanted it to be. There is no more file sharing. There is no more peer-to-peer culture. They sold us the idea of platforms and now platforms have been enshittified in a way that we create things for them while they dictate back the rules that we should comply use our own creations. It's a game where you are set to lose and they are set to profit.</p>
            <p>This place is meant to counter this culture. The Big Five have created products aimed to make the masses addicted, feeding us their opinions until we think they are our own. We must take back our place in the internet. We must take back our privacy and our identity. Humans aren't free data to be trained on. Humans aren't merchandise.</p>
            <p>Could you imagine being truly free?</p>
            <p>Coming soon...</p>
