            <p>Sharing knowledge and information is the true purpose of the internet. Big corporations have taken ownership of the space we crafted with our friends and turned it into a machine designed to drain our belongings - mental and physical - while turning us into the products.</p>
            <p>Where did we go wrong?</p>
            <p>How did we let it come to this?</p>
            <p>The internet is finally boring and stupid, like they wanted it to be. There is no more free file sharing. There is no more peer-to-peer culture. Want some music? Pay a subscription. Want to watch a movie? Pay a subscription. But if you don't want to pay and still want to watch someone live a insightful moment or give you some information or advice on a "free platform"? No worries, we got you covered - with 30+ seconds ads. Buy shit you don't need. Buy shit you don't care about. Buy shit you'll be excited for the next 48 hours, only to throw it back into a a drawer or into the trash. Buy. That is what we are all about now.</p>
            <p>This place is meant to counter this culture. The Big Five have created products that make the masses addicted, feeding us their opinions until we think they' are our own. We must take back our place in the internet. We must take back our privacy and our identity. Humans are not free data to be trained on by the AI they're now trying to sell us back. Humans aren't merchandise.</p>
            <p>Could you imagine being truly free?</p>
            <p>Coming soon...</p>
